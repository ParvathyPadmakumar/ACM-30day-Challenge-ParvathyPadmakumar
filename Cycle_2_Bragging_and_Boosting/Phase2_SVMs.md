# SVM

## Documentation

linear kernel

- uses straight hyperplane
- Fails if fraud points lie inside non-linear regions

rbf kernel

- projects data into infinte-dimensional space
- works when fraud patterns are in non-linear regions

polynomial kernel

- higher-dimensional polynomial space
- curved but rigid

soft margin or violations of margin by c parameter

- low c offers faster runtime(wide margin)
