### ⚙️ Methods Applied

- Imputation of missing values using mean for nominal data and median for categorical data
- Outlier treatment using IQR method
- Encoding of categorical features using OneHotEncoding
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Model training with Logistic Regression,Lasso,Ridge and Random Forest
- Comparison of model before data cleaning and model after data cleaning,outlier removal and feature selection using random forest

### 📏 Evaluation Metrics

- Boxplot
